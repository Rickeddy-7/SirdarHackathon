# Sirdar x WeThinkCode_ Hackathon 2023

## Problem Statement:
Sirdar is looking to automate the way in which they provide their services to clients. The challenge is to create a system that facilitates the process of consulting with their customers in a more quick and efficient way so they can help their clients faster and more effectively.

## Proposed Solution:
A streamlit powered application where Sirdar can facilitate its survey and clients can view the results on the very same platform. We also added an AI feature where the recommendations are given by Azure OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo model. Clients and Sirdar can collaborate seamlessly on the platform and analytics are shared in real time
